### Background
I'm Trevor, a freelance UI designer with 10 years of wonderful experience helping clients worldwide with exciting designs. I also practice and actively learn front-end development using a variety of languages such as ember.js, RubyOnRails, Elixir, and Node.js. Some time ago, I decided it was best to see my "designs" come to life, hence my introduction to the wonderful world of code.
