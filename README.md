### Background
Having a portfolio, I believe is one of the main points of setting yourself apart from code hobbyists. There's nothing wrong with that (at all!), but if you want to be seen as a growing professional, it helps.

I've also added incomplete projects on here as a way to "push" me in the right direction. If it's public, I have to do it right?!

### My Projects
