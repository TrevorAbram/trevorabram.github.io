### Background
I'm Trevor, a freelance UI designer with 6 years of experience. I also practice and actively learn front-end development using JavaScript and React(and sometimes Ember.js). Some time ago, I decided it was best to see my "designs" come to life, hence my introduction to the wonderful world of code.

To work with me on a project or for consultations, shoot me a message or email. You can also find me on Instagram [@TrevDoesDigital](https://instagram.com/Trevdoesdigital)
